# Minesweeper-Clone
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game. This game initially released in 1989 making it a classic. The main objective of this game is to clear a board containing bombs that are covered. The game board contains 288 "cells" that are covered. Once pressed, they either reveal a blank, numbers 1-8, or a bomb. The numbers correspond with how many bombs are touching that cell. And if a bomb is clicked, then the game is over.
