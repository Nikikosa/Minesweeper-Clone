# Minesweeper-Clone
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game. This game initially released in 1989 making it a classic. The main objective of this game is to clear a board containing bombs that are covered. The game board contains 288 "cells" that are covered. Once pressed, they either reveal a blank, numbers 1-8, or a bomb. The numbers correspond with how many bombs are touching that cell. And if a bomb is clicked, then the game is over.

I have decided to recreate this game as practice with GUI's and algorithm development. I did not use any tutorials or external programming help. I recreated this game using my current knowlegde of programming, self taught GUI principles, and algorithim development. All of the code you are seeing here is 100% my work. However, I did receive external help on the pixel artwork done within this program. This art work was done by my freind Danilo N. 

Hope everyone enjoys playing this game, and perhaps even leaving feedback!
